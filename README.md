# goodWill

## Overview
goodWill started with a simple goal—to make finding blood donors quick and hassle-free during emergencies. Our platform connects patients in urgent need of blood with registered donors, nearby blood banks, and hospitals through a real-time, location-based search system. Patients can enter their blood type and details to find matching resources quickly. Donors register their information, view a list of patients, and choose to donate. Upon donation, they receive confirmation and earn 15 reward points. Once they accumulate 100 points, they unlock perks like free health check-ups, encouraging regular participation. The solution creates an efficient, secure, and incentivized ecosystem that bridges the gap between donors and those in need, ensuring faster and more reliable access to life-saving blood.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**:
   Node.js & Express.js (with TypeScript) – Scalable backend using TypeScript for type safety and Express.js for clean API design.
