# goodWill

## Overview
goodWill started with a simple goal—to make finding blood donors quick and hassle-free during emergencies. Our platform connects patients in urgent need of blood with registered donors, nearby blood banks, and hospitals through a real-time, location-based search system. Patients can enter their blood type and details to find matching resources quickly. Donors register their information, view a list of patients, and choose to donate. Upon donation, they receive confirmation and earn 15 reward points. Once they accumulate 100 points, they unlock perks like free health check-ups, encouraging regular participation. The solution creates an efficient, secure, and incentivized ecosystem that bridges the gap between donors and those in need, ensuring faster and more reliable access to life-saving blood.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**:
   React.js – Component-based library for building fast and interactive user interfaces.

- **Backend**:
   Node.js & Express.js (with TypeScript) – Scalable backend using TypeScript for type safety and Express.js for clean API design.

- **Database**:
   MongoDB – NoSQL database optimized for flexibility and handling complex, unstructured data.
  
## Usage
1. **Patients**: Register/Login → Enter blood type & urgency → Search for donors → Request blood → Receive confirmation.
2. **Donors**: Register/Login → View blood requests → Confirm donation → Earn points.
3. **Blood Banks/Hospitals**: Register/Login → Update blood stock → Respond to patient requests.
